# ðŸ“¦ SimplePersist â€“ A Simple Local Persistence Layer

**SimplePersist** is a lightweight and educational library designed for local data storage with a unified interface. It currently supports reading, writing, updating, and deleting data from CSV files and is designed to be easily extendable to other lightweight storage formats such as JSON files, IndexedDB, SQLite, and more.

The goal is to offer a simple and consistent API for working with structured data without the need for a full database engine â€” ideal for learning, prototyping, or small-scale apps.
